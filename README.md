JavaScript project to demonstrate my knowledge on beginner and advanced concepts.

## Description

I have created my project to demonstrate my advanced knowledge of Javascript. I have used my own knowlege and researched a lot of my problems to make a solution. I have learned how to use for functions, objects and more asvanced techniques with arrays. I haven't yet been able to completely finish the project. Refer to the console in the Chrome dev tools to see what I have done. Refer to the code file to see the code.

## Installation
