# password-generator-challenge

## Description

I have created my project to demonstrate my advanced knowledge of Javascript. I have used my own knowlege and researched a lot of my problems to make a solution. I have learned how to use for functions, objects and more advanced techniques with arrays. I haven't yet been able to completely finish the project. Refer to the console in the Chrome dev tools to see what I have done.
